## Modelesult

## Dependency package
1. Dlib (http://dlib.net/)    install the Dlib "Link"
2. Opencv
3. Tensorflow
4. Numpy
5. Pillow(PIL)

## Deploy the project

1. Download the model from Link( ) '\n'
2. Place it in the 'model/' (you also need to rewrite the name of the model or the file path if you changed)
